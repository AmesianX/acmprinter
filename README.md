# ACM Virtual Printer

This is a very simple web server (one file, no setup) capable of listing, viewing and uploading files.
 
Its main purpose is to serve as an 'emulated printer' for practicing programming contests (instead of wasting paper, it allows to see the code from another computer). It uses [Google Code Prettifier](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) to show the code.

Usage
=====
1. Clone this repository:

    > git clone https://github.com/mvpossum/acmprinter

    > cd acmprinter

2. Start the server:

   > python2 acmprinter.py

   It listens at port 8080. If run from the console it tells you the local address to access the webserver.

3. Access the webserver locally [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or inside your local network using your IP.

Interface is kept as minimal as possible.
